    title: " DO I NEED A VISA TO GO TO GEORGIA?",
    description:
      "If you want to visit Georgia, I have good news: Georgia is very generous with its tourist visa regulations! Citizens from the European Union, North America, Australia, and the countries on this list can enter Georgia visa-free for 365 days! This means that you can just show up at the airport of Tbilisi, Kutaisi and Batumi or at any land border and you'll be allowed to enter Georgia. If your country of residency is not on that list, you'll have to apply for an e-visa, which will allow you to stay for 30 or 90 days, depending on your home country.",

    title: "FUN AND UNIQUE THINGS TO DO IN GEORGIA: WINE TASTING",
    description:
      "Georgia is the homeland of wine, so it comes as no surprise that any activities related to wine are a must-try. Starting from making qvevri (a clay pot where Georgians traditionally keep wine) and putting them in the ground to simple wine tasting and making churchkhela with grape juice, these activities will give you an insight into the Georgian culture, which is so different from everything else you've experienced before! If you're traveling in Georgia in the fall, try to participate in the wine harvest. If you happen to be around in spring, you should join the qvevri opening ritual during which you get to taste the first taste of the previous harvest!",
